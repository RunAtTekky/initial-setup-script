# Initial Setup Script
Use this command to run the script
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://runat.xyz/init.sh)
```

## Requirements
- My GitHub login credentials (coz I'm cloning private repos)

## Current progress
- [x] Works on Omarchy with my GH credentials
- [ ] Allow someone without my GH credentials to use this script
